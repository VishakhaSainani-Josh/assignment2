2. What does the git `ls-files` command do, and what information does its output provide regarding the state of files in a Git repository?



git ls-files command gives the names of all the files that are in the staging area basically the files that are added in all the branches,


 it provides the information about the files that are being tracked by git.

 it does not show ignored files.

 to check ignored files we can use command : git ls-files --ignored

 and to check other files that are not in the staging are we can use --o i.e. --others
